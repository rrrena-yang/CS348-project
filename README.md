# CS348-project

Our big idea is to develop a song-review web app. The database of the web app stores information such as textual reviews of songs, ratings of songs, song titles, song authors, singers, etc. The web app will support functionalities such as: sorting songs based on artists, regions, languages, trending, and reviews; searching for songs; adding/removing reviews for songs, etc.
